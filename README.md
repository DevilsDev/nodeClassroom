# nodeClassroom
***Express*** is a minimal node.js framework, which means it is built on top of node.js. It is a higher level of abstraction, but behind the scenes, Express is written 100% using node.js code; it is also the most popular node.js framework. There are a couple of others, but Express has kind of become the standard.

 So, Express contains a very robust and handy set of features, things like complex routing, easier handling of requests and responses, adding middleware, server-side rendering, and much more are all included out of the box.

This allows us to write node.js applications so much faster than before because we do not have to reinvent the wheel. We do not have to repeat the same code repeatedly each time we need to implement some complex routing some templating system. So all of that is already included in Express, ready for us to use. Also, Express makes it easier to organize our application into the MVC architecture, a prevalent software architecture pattern.
